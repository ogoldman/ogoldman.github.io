= Architecture

An _architecture_ is the set of components that compose a system, the relationships between them, and the principles that govern those over time.

Relationships and principles can be both positive, describing what can be done, and negative, describing constraints that should not be violated.

An architecture is similar to a _design language_. However, design languages tend to place an emphasis on construction (available elements, and how they can be combined) and less so on contraints. See link:/reviews/Winograd96[Winograd96], Chapter 4.
