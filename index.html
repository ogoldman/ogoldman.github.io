        <h1>An Architect's Miscellany</h1>
        <p>A collection of useful things from twenty-five years of architectural practice.</p>

        <p>Some essays, making the argument for relevant ideas.</p>
        
        <p>A bibliography of books I've read, including some of which I recommend.</p>
        
        <p>A dictionary, because it's impossible to communicate with precision without a precise vocabulary.</p>
